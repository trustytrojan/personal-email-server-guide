# DKIM is a method to cryptographically sign your emails to prove that they haven't been tampered with in transit.
# Generate a private key on your mail server with `openssl genrsa -out /etc/dkim_private.key`.
# Output the public key in the format suitable for this DNS record with `openssl rsa -in /etc/dkim_private.key -pubout -outform der 2>/dev/null | openssl base64 -A`.
# Use the record below, pasting your public key after the `p=`.
# `mail` is the selector which needs to be the same as the `selector` in `/etc/rspamd.conf` or the `-s` option in the `filter-dkimsign` command in `/etc/smtpd.conf` (depending on which filter you chose).
